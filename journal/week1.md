-  **Implemented a healthcheck in the Docker compose file for the frontend**

```
  frontend-react-js:
    environment:

    build: ./frontend-react-js
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    volumes:
      - ./frontend-react-js:/frontend-react-js
    healthcheck:
      test: curl --fail http://localhost:3000 || exit 1
      interval: 60s
      retries: 5
      start_period: 20s
      timeout: 10s
```
